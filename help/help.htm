<h1>Dlcounter_XH &ndash; a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../dlcounter.png" alt="Download"
     style="width: 128px; height: 128px; float: left">
<p>Dlcounter_XH is a simple download counter for CMSimple_XH. Instead of a link
to the downloadable file, it offers the download as HTML form, which should be
ignored by bots, so the download count is somewhat more accurate. Please note
that absolute accurate download counts cannot be archieved with Dlcounter_XH
(and probably neither with any other download counter) as e.g. cancelled
downloads or multiple downloads initiated by download managers are not
especially catered for.</p>
<p>Download statistics are available in the administration part of the
plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation, <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>
<p><strong>Dlcounter_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments.
It is a so called beta version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Dlcounter_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires a UTF-8 encoded version,
and PHP &ge; 5.1.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole folder monorder/ to your server into the plugins/ folder
of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subfolders css/, config/, languages/ and the
plugin's data folder.</li>
<li>Protect Dlcounter_XH's data folder against direct access by any means your
webserver provides. .htaccess files for Apache servers are already placed in the
default data folder.</li>
<li>Browse to Dlcounter_XH's administration to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as for many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select Plugins&rarr;Dlcounter.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Dlcounter_XH under "Config". Hints
for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Dlcounter_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>All downloads that shall be counted have to placed directly in the configured
downloads folder (see Config&rarr;Folder&rarr;Downloads). To display the
download form for the file download.pdf on a page, enter:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:dlcounter('download.pdf');}}}</pre>
<p>You can safely check if the download works as expected, by triggering it
when you are logged in as administrator; these downloads will not be counted. If
you like to use another PNG image for the download button, you can exchange
the default one in the plugin's images/ folder. There are aleady some
alternatives with different color schemes.</p>
<p>To prohibit direct downloading of the files (somebody may be able to guess a
file's URL), you have to protect the configured download folder by any means
your server provides (for Apache servers you can use a copy of
data/.htaccess).</p>
<p>To view the download statistics just switch to
Plugins&rarr;Dlcounter&rarr;Statistics. You can sort the tables by clicking on
the respective column heading.</p>
