<img src="../dlcounter.png" class="logo" alt="Download Processor">
<p>
    Dlcounter_XH is a simple download counter for CMSimple_XH. Instead of a link
    to the downloadable file, it offers the download as HTML form, which should
    be ignored by bots, so the download count is somewhat more accurate. Please
    note that absolute accurate download counts cannot be archieved with
    Dlcounter_XH (and probably neither with any other download counter) as e.g.
    cancelled downloads or multiple downloads initiated by download managers are
    not especially catered to.
</p>
<p>
    Download statistics are available in the administration part of the plugin.

</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as for many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Dlcounter</i>.
</p>
<p>
    You can change the default settings of Dlcounter_XH under <i>Config</i>.
    Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon
    with your mouse.
</p>

    strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
    or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>

</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    All downloads that shall be counted have to placed directly in the
    configured downloads folder (see <i>Config</i> → <i>Folder</i> →
    <i>Downloads</i>). To display the download form for the file
    <code>download.pdf</code> on a page, enter:
</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:dlcounter('download.pdf')}}}</pre>
<p>
    You can safely check if the download works as expected, by triggering it
    when you are logged in as administrator; these downloads will not be
    counted.
</p>
<p class="important">
    To prohibit direct downloading of the files (somebody may be able to guess a
    file's URL), you have to protect the configured download folder by any means
    your server provides (for Apache servers you can usually use a copy of
    <code>cmsimple/.htaccess</code>).
</p>
<p>
    To view the download statistics just browse to <i>Plugins</i> →
    <i>Dlcounter</i> → <i>Statistics</i>. You can sort the tables by clicking on
    the respective column heading.
</p>
</section>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    If the Fileinfo PHP extension is not available, the downloads will be sent
    with the generic MIME type <i>application/octet-stream</i>.  This
    <em>may</em> result in imperfect behavior of some browsers, but is usually
    nothing you have to be concerned with.
