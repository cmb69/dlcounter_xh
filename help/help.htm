<h1 id="dlcounter_xh">Dlcounter_XH</h1>
<p>Dlcounter_XH is a simple download counter for CMSimple_XH. Instead of a link to the downloadable file, it offers the download as HTML form, which should be ignored by bots, so the download count is somewhat more accurate. Please note that absolute accurate download counts cannot be archieved with Dlcounter_XH (and probably neither with any other download counter) as e.g. cancelled downloads or multiple downloads initiated by download managers are not especially catered to.</p>
<p>Download statistics are available in the administration part of the plugin.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Dlcounter_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 and PHP ≥ 7.1.0. Dlcounter_XH also requires <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH</a> ≥ 1.2; if that is not already installed (see <code>Settings</code> → <code>Info</code>), get the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a>, and install it.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/dlcounter_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>dlcounter/</code> to your server into the plugins directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Dlcounter</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the Website. Go to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Dlcounter</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Dlcounter_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icons with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language (if there is no appropriate language file available), or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Dlcounter_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>All downloads that shall be counted have to placed directly in the configured downloads folder (see <code>Config</code> → <code>Folder</code> → <code>Downloads</code>). To display the download form for the file <code>download.pdf</code> on a page, enter:</p>
<pre><code>{{{dlcounter(&#39;download.pdf&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>You can safely check if the download works as expected, by triggering it when you are logged in as administrator; these downloads will not be counted.</p>
<p>To prohibit direct downloading of the files (somebody may be able to guess the URL of a file), you have to protect the configured download folder by any means your server provides (for Apache servers you can usually use a copy of <code>cmsimple/.htaccess</code>).</p>
<p>To view the download statistics browse to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Dlcounter</code> → <code>Statistics</code>. You can sort the tables by clicking on the respective column heading.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>If the Fileinfo PHP extension is not available, the downloads will be sent with the generic MIME type <code>application/octet-stream</code>. This <em>may</em> result in imperfect behavior of some browsers, but is usually nothing you have to be concerned with.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Report bugs and ask for support either on <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/dlcounter_xh/issues">Github</a> or in the <a href="https://cmsimpleforum.com/">CMSimple_XH Forum</a>.</p>
